STEP 1: what I learned so far?

I learned how to create divs (div.class)
How to move a code t another line.
How to create multiple single elements with the "ALT" button 
learned to apply HTML comments the easy way. (ctrl /) :D 

What I love so Far? I love that we're using VSCODE. I always thought
it was complicated so I used Webstorm instead.
But I am absolutely loving this, only becuase the instructor makes it fun!
This would be my go to IDE from now on!
The lessons are really understandable! I have tweo different HTML/CSS 
certficates and just this basic made me feel as though this is the first
time I'm learning HTML.

First time knowing host fonts are imported. I never checked lol. Now I'll be
happy to import as many as I want to.
